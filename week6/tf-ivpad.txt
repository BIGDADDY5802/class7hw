# Inititializing and applying a terraform configuration

1) First thing you do is create a directory for your terraform files.
    -   <tffiles1>
    Good practice to date your directory or give it a number so you can search 
    for them and find them easily. Also crete a main.tf file in your terraform folder.

2) Go to this github repo and copy these files raw, modify the files so that they fit your configuration
        <https://github.com/BIGDADDY5802/class7hw/blob/main/week6/week6tf/main.tf>

3) After modifying the files for you we then put the command:
        $terraform init
    This commamd initialises terraform into AWS for you

        $terraform validate
    This command checks the syntax of your code. Makes sure you have everything right,
    this is only validating syntax.

        $terraform plan
    This command is the one before the work gets done, it lays the plan that it is gonna
    execute and shows you the plan in the terminal for you to review

        $terraform apply
    This command launches and sends your commands to AWS for you, in a couple minutes at
    most you have built infrastructure in AWS.
