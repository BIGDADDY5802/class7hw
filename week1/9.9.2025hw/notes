Cloud Computing - a new computing paradigm that involves delivering applications and services over the internet

- Came into existence with the evolution of a variety of technologies such as virtualization and distributed computing

Compute services in the cloud are dynamically scalable, capacity is provisioned virtually.

    Features:
        Scalable
        Flexible
        Secure
        Cost effective

Amazon ec2 is an IaaS feature offered by AWS, it is server provisioned virtually in the cloud, commonly referred to as instances. There are various instance types:
        General Purpose
        Compute Optimized
        Memory Optimized
        Accelerated Computing
        Storage Optimized

Pricing Options:
        On-demand
        Reserved
        Spot

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - an instance template that contains the software configuration required to launch an instance.
    AMIs come from:
        AWS
        AWS Communities and Marketplace
        Communities not on AWS (Public)
        AMIs also come from your existing instances

Virtualization= A process that allows a computer to share its hardware resources with multiple digitally seperated environments, the technology that enables the creation of virtual environments from a single physical machine.

Virtualization uses software called hypervisors to create multiple virtual computers (vms) on a single physical machine.
Each virtual machine runs on its own OS and functions like a completely seperate machine, though the virtual machine can access all the parts of the physical machine.
With this you get one machine running multiple tasks, instead of seperate machines running one task, it is sharing the hardware of one physical computer.

Various forms of Virtualization:
    Full Virtualization
    Para Virtualization
    Hardware Virtualization

Hypervisor - The virtualization layer consists of hypervisor or VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor). This presents a virtual operating platform to guest OS.

Guest OS - an operating system that is installed in a VM in addition to the Host or main OS.
