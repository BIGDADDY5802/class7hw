Hi they call me J-Hunt

My yearly net income is 350,000

I live in Thailand and Japan on my own plots of land

My houses are custom for my job on one side and the other is by the lake where we sleep...

My thread count is 2000 because it feels good to slide around in my bed at night

I vacation frequently to Maldives:
